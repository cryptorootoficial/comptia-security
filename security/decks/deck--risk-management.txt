Evidence in the form of business records, printouts, manuals, and similar objects, which make up much of the evidence relating to computer crimes, is documentary evidence. Demonstrative evidence is used to aid the jury and can be in the form of a model, experiment, chart, and so on, offered to prove that an event occurred.;risk-management
Which rule states that evidence is not admissible if it was collected in violation of the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition of unreasonable search and seizure?<p>A. Best evidence rule</p><p>B. Hearsay rule</p><p>C. Exclusionary rule</p><p>D. Legal hold rule</p>;C. The Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution precludes illegal search and seizure. Therefore, any evidence collected in violation of the Fourth Amendment is not admissible as evidence. This is addressed by the exclusionary rule. The best evidence rule addresses the fact that courts prefer original evidence rather than a copy, to ensure that no alteration of the evidence (whether intentional or unintentional) has occurred. Hearsay rule addesses second-hand evidence—evidence offered by the witness that is not based on the personal knowledge of the witness but is being offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. There was no discussion of a direct evidence rule.;risk-management

Documenting all actions taken</p><p>D. Witness preparation</p>;A. While all of these are important, from the initial step in the forensics process, the most important issue must always be preservation of the data.;risk-management
Which of the following policies addresses the need for other employees who can do the job of each employee so that corruption does not occur, and also helps minimize the impact when personnel leave their jobs?<p>A. Acceptable use</p><p>B. Least privilege</p><p>C. Mandatory vacations</p><p>D. Privacy policy</p>;C. Mandatory vacations addresses the need for other employees who can do the job of each employee. This helps mitigate corruption and minimizes the impact when personnel resign from their positions. Answer A is incorrect because an organization’s acceptable use policy provides details specifying what users may do with their network access. Answer B is incorrect. Least privilege addresses access rights for user accounts, mandating that only the minimum permissions necessary to perform work should be assigned to a user. Answer D is incorrect because privacy policy describes federal and state legislation requiring owners of commercial websites or online services to post how they collect and protect personal data.;risk-management
An organization is partnering with another organization that requires shared systems. Which of the following documents outlines how the shared systems will interface?<p>A. SLA</p><p>B. BPA</p><p>C. MOU</p><p>D. ISA</p>;D. An interconnection security agreement (ISA) is an agreement between organizations that have connected IT systems. Answer A is incorrect because a service level agreement (SLA) is a contract between a service provider and a customer that specifies the nature of the service to be provided and the level of service that the provider will offer to the customer. Answer B is incorrect because a business partner agreement (BPA) is a contract that establishes partner profit percentages, partner responsibilities, and exit strategies for partners. Answer C is incorrect because a memorandum of understanding (MOU) is a document that outlines the terms and details of an agreement between parties, including each party’s requirements and responsibilities.;risk-management
Which of the following are steps an organization can take to be sure compliance and performance standards are met in third-party or partner agreements? (Select two correct answers.)<p>A. Implement an acceptable use policy</p><p>B. Take appropriate action if the relationship presents elevated risk</p><p>C. Review third-party arrangements and performance annually</p><p>D. Sign a data ownership agreement</p>;B and C. Some additional steps an organization can take to ensure that compliance and performance standards are met include approving and reviewing third-party arrangements and performance annually, maintaining an updated list of all third-party relationships and reviewing the list periodically, taking appropriate action with any relationship that presents elevated risk, and reviewing all contracts for compliance with expectations and obligations. Answer A is incorrect because an acceptable use policy is geared toward terms a user must agree to follow to be provided with access service. Answer D is incorrect because a data ownership agreement is an agreement that some cloud service providers offer that specifically identifies the data owner and outlines ownership of relevant data.;risk-management
Which of the following requires users to remove sensitive and confidential materials from workspaces and lock items that are not in use when they leave their workstations?<p>A. Data handling policy</p><p>B. Clean desk policy</p><p>C. Tailgating training</p><p>D. Phishing attack training</p>;B. A clean desk policy requires users to remove sensitive and confidential materials from workspaces and to also lock items that are not in use when they leave their workstations. Answer A is incorrect because a data handling policy should address legal or regulatory requirements for accessing, transporting, storing, or disposing of data and data storage devices. Answer C is incorrect because tailgating involves following an authorized individual to avoid having to provide personal authorization credentials. Answer D is incorrect because phishing attacks training teaches users to avoid the natural response of opening every email that seems to be coming from family members, a boss, or coworkers.;risk-management
Which of the following designates the amount of data loss that is sustainable and up to what point in time data recovery could happen before business is disrupted?<p>A. RTO</p><p>B. MTBF</p><p>C. RPO</p><p>D. MTTF</p>;C. The recovery point objective (RPO) is the amount of time that can elapse during a disruption before the quantity of data lost during that period exceeds business continuity planning’s maximum allowable threshold. Simply put, RPO specifies the allowable data loss. It determines up to what point in time data recovery can happen before business is disrupted. Answer A is incorrect because the recovery time objective (RTO) is the amount of time within which a process must be restored after a disaster to meet business continuity. It defines how much time it takes to recover after notification of process disruption. Answer B is incorrect because mean time between failures (MTBF) is the average amount of time that passes between hardware component failures, excluding time spent waiting for or undergoing repairs. Answer D is incorrect because mean time to failure (MTTF) is the length of time a device or product is expected to last in operation.;risk-management
Eliminating email to avoid the risk of email-borne viruses is an effective solution but is not likely to be a realistic approach for which of the following?<p>A. Risk avoidance</p><p>B. Risk transference</p><p>C. Risk acceptance</p><p>D. Risk mitigation</p>;A. Risk avoidance involves eliminating the vulnerability that gives rise to a particular risk so that it is avoided altogether. This is the most effective solution, but is often not possible due to organizational requirements. Answer B is incorrect because risk transference involves either moving the risk to hosted providers who assume the responsibility for recovery and restoration or acquiring insurance to cover the costs from a risk. Answer C is incorrect because risk acceptance involves recognizing a risk, identifying it, and then accepting that it is sufficiently unlikely or of such limited impact that corrective controls are not warranted. Answer D is incorrect because risk mitigation involves reducing the likelihood or impact of a risk’s exposure by putting systems and policies into place to mitigate a risk and guard against the exploitation of vulnerabilities.;risk-management
Which of the following parties typically are notified first when a confirmed incident has occurred? (Select two correct answers.)<p>A. Press</p><p>B. CISO</p><p>C. End users</p><p>D. Legal</p>;B and D. The exact reporting requirements vary among organizations, but parties that are typically notified include the Chief Information Officer (CIO), Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), other internal incident response team members, human resources officers, public affairs personnel, the legal department, and law enforcement officers, when necessary. Answer A is incorrect because the press is not normally notified when an incident occurs. Answer C is incorrect because the users are not normally notified initially when an incident occurs.;risk-management
In which of the following types of analysis might an examiner have difficulty proving that the evidence is original?<p>A. Disk-to-image file</p><p>B. Disk-to-disk image</p><p>C. Big data</p><p>D. Log files</p>;C. Because big data is unstructured and located in diverse environments, the examiner might have difficulty proving that the evidence is original: The data has neither a validating hash nor a forensic image of the device. Answer A is incorrect because disk-to-image files are hashed to prove originality. Answer B is incorrect because disk-to-disk images are hashed to prove originality. Answer D is incorrect because when logs are needed as court evidence, organizations can collect copies of the original log files, the centralized log files, and interpreted log data.;risk-management
Which of the following information should be collected when collecting volatile data? (Select all correct answers.)<p>A. System date and time</p><p>B. Current network connections</p><p>C. Current open ports and applications listening on those ports</p><p>D. Full disk image</p>;A, B, and C. The following volatile information should be collected: system date and time, current network connections, current open ports and applications listening on those ports, and applications currently running. Answer D is incorrect because a full disk image is not volatile data.;risk-management
Which of the following provides a clear record of the path evidence takes from acquisition to disposal?<p>A. Video capture</p><p>B. Chain of custody</p><p>C. Hashes</p><p>D. Witness statements</p>;B. The chain of custody provides a clear record of the path evidence takes from acquisition to disposal. Answer A is incorrect because videotaping the actual entrance of a forensics team into the area helps refute claims that evidence was planted at the scene. Answer C is incorrect because hashes allow validation that the forensic analysis itself has not produced unexpected modifications of evidentiary data. Answer D is incorrect because witnesses provide statements about what they saw, including when, where, and how.;risk-management
Which recovery site has only power, telecommunications, and networking active all the time?<p>A. Hot site</p><p>B. Cold site</p><p>C. Warm site</p><p>D. Shielded site</p>;C. The warm site has basics such as power, networking, and telecommunications active all the time. Although alternate computers might be present, they are not loaded and operational as in a hot site, making answer A incorrect. Answer B is incorrect because a cold site generally includes only power and physical space when not in use. Answer D is incorrect because any of the recovery site types might or might not be shielded against electromagnetic interference.;risk-management
If an organization takes a full backup every Sunday morning and a daily differential backup each morning, what is the fewest number of backups that must be restored following a disaster on Friday?<p>A. 1</p><p>B. 2</p><p>C. 5</p><p>D. 6</p>;B. With a differential backup scheme, only the last full and last differential backups need to be restored. Therefore, daily full backups would require only the last full backup, making Answer A incorrect in this configuration. Answer C is incorrect because only the last full and last differential backups need to be restored. Answer D is incorrect because six is correct for an incremental backup instead of a differential backup, where the last full backup and all intervening incremental backups must be restored for recovery.;risk-management
Which one of the following best provides an example of detective controls versus prevention controls?<p>A. IDS/camera versus IPS/guard</p><p>B. IDS/IPS versus camera/guard</p><p>C. IPS/camera versus IDS/guard</p><p>D. IPS versus guard</p>;A. Both IDS and a camera are examples of detective controls. IPS and a guard are examples of prevention controls. Answers B, C, and D are incorrect because they do not properly align the detective control against the prevention control.;risk-management
Which one of the following federal laws addresses privacy, data protection, and breach notification?<p>A. HIPAA</p><p>B. Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act</p><p>C. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act</p><p>D. All of the above</p>;D.

Examples of personally identifiable information (PII) are name, address, phone number, fax number, email address, financial profiles, social security number, and credit card information. PII is not limited to these examples: It includes any other personal information that is linked or linkable to an individual. Answers C and D are incorrect because, individually, they are not considered to be PII, only when combined with other information could they become PII.;risk-management
Which of the following is information that is unlikely to result in a high-level financial loss or serious damage to the organization but whose confidentiality should still be protected?<p>A. Public data</p><p>B. Confidential data</p><p>C. Sensitive data</p><p>D. Private data</p>;D. Private data is information that is unlikely to result in a high-level financial loss or serious damage to the organization but that still should be protected. Answer A is incorrect because the unauthorized disclosure, alteration, or destruction of public data would result in little or no risk to the organization. Answer B is incorrect because confidential information is internal information that defines the way in which the organization operates. Security should be high. Answer C is incorrect because sensitive data is considered confidential data.;risk-management
