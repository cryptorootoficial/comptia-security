Covert network threat</p><p>B. Advanced persistent threat</p><p>C. Covert channel attack</p><p>D. Concealed network presence</p>;B. Advanced persistent threats (APTs) are attacks characterized by using toolkits to achieve a presence on a target network and then, instead of just moving to steal information, focusing on the long game, maintaining a persistence on the target network. Their tactics, tools, and procedures are focused on maintaining administrative access to the target network and avoiding detection. Covert channels are indeed a concern in security but are a special category of attack. The other terms are not generally used in the security community.;threats-attacks-vulnerabilities
Which of the following are reasons that the insider threat is considered so dangerous? (Choose all that apply.)<p>A. Insiders have the access and knowledge necessary to cause immediate damage to an organization.</p><p>B. Insiders may actually already have all the access they need to perpetrate criminal activity such as fraud.</p><p>C. Insiders generally do not have knowledge of the security systems in place, so system monitoring will allow for any inappropriate activity to be detected.</p><p>D. Attacks by insiders are often the result of employees who have become disgruntled with their organization and are looking for ways to disrupt operations.</p>;A, B, and D. Insiders frequently do have knowledge of the security systems in place and are thus better able to avoid detection.;threats-attacks-vulnerabilities
When discussing threat concerns regarding competitors, which of the following is true?<p>A. There are no known cases of criminal activity involving people moving from competitor to competitor, taking insider information with them for years.</p><p>B. Where in the past it would take significant risk to copy the detailed engineering specifications of a major process for a firm, today it can be accomplished with a few clicks and a USB drive.</p><p>C. Modern search engines make it less likely that a competitor could steal intellectual property without being detected.</p><p>D. With increases in digital forensics, it is now more difficult to copy and steal proprietary digital information or disrupt operations.</p>;B. In today’s world of global economic activity, much of it is enabled by the interconnected nature of businesses. Many businesses have an information component that is easier to copy, steal, or disrupt than older, more physical assets. Additionally, there have been cases of people moving from competitor to competitor, taking insider information with them for years, even decades, before the Internet was developed.;threats-attacks-vulnerabilities
Which of the following are true concerning attacker skill and sophistication? (Choose all that apply.)<p>A. The level of complexity for modern networks and operating systems has grown so that it is nearly impossible for anyone but the most skilled of hackers to gain unauthorized access to computer systems and networks.</p><p>B. Attackers do not have magic skills, but rather the persistence and skill to keep attacking weaknesses.</p><p>C. With the introduction of cloud computing during the last decade, attackers now primarily focus on the cloud, thus reducing the level of sophistication required to conduct attacks since they can focus on a more limited environment.</p><p>D. There is a surprising number of attacks being performed using old attacks, old vulnerabilities, and simple methods that take advantage of “low-hanging fruit.”</p>;B and D. While the complexity of systems is indeed increasing, there still exists a large number of computers and networks that have not been adequately protected, making it possible for less sophisticated attackers to gain unauthorized access. Additionally, while cloud computing has added another focus for attackers, it has not eliminated computer systems and networks in general as potential targets.;threats-attacks-vulnerabilities

A credentialed scan is performed with a valid userid/password.</p><p>C. A non-credentialed scan uses passive techniques.</p><p>D. A non-credentialed scan will identify more vulnerabilities.</p>;B. A credentialed scan is performed with a valid set of user credentials. Credentialed scans are performed with “valid user” access and have the potential to identify vulnerabilities inside an application or environment.;threats-attacks-vulnerabilities
While validating a vulnerability, your colleague changes the password of the administrator account on the Windows Server she is examining (as proof of success). This is an example of what type of testing?<p>A. Intrusive testing</p><p>B. Credentialed testing</p><p>C. Passive testing</p><p>D. Security control testing</p>;A. This is an example of intrusive testing. Intrusive testing to validate a vulnerability involves exploiting the vulnerability and then making changes to the tested item to prove the vulnerability is present and exploitable. In this case, changing the administrator password proves your colleague could exploit the vulnerability she found.;threats-attacks-vulnerabilities
A colleague shows you a scanning report indicating your web server is not vulnerable to the Heartbleed bug. You know this isn’t true as you’ve personally verified that web server is vulnerable. You believe the scanner used to examine your web server is reporting which of the following?<p>A. Common misconfiguration</p><p>B. False positive</p><p>C. False negative</p><p>D. SSL mismatch</p>;C. A false negative is when the scanner fails to report a vulnerability that actually does exist—the scanner simply missed the problem or didn’t report it as a problem.;threats-attacks-vulnerabilities
Which of the following would be an example of initial exploitation?<p>A. Scanning a network using Nmap</p><p>B. Using a SQL injection attack to successfully bypass a login prompt</p><p>C. Using cracked credentials to delete customer data</p><p>D. Installing a backdoor to provide future access if needed</p>;B. Using a SQL injection attack to successfully bypass a login prompt is an example of initial exploitation. The vulnerability was identified and exploited, but no further action was taken. This proves the existence of the vulnerability and demonstrates the risk associated with the vulnerability.;threats-attacks-vulnerabilities

Vulnerability scans are performed from internal and external perspectives.</p><p>C. Penetration tests exploit discovered vulnerabilities.</p><p>D. Vulnerability scans never use credentials.</p>;C. Penetration testing is the examination of a system for vulnerabilities that can be exploited. The key is exploitation. There may be vulnerabilities in a system, in fact, one of the early steps in penetration testing is the examination for vulnerabilities, but the differentiation comes in the follow-on steps—the examination of the system in terms of exploitability. Discovered vulnerabilities are exploited during penetration testing.;threats-attacks-vulnerabilities
You’re reviewing a custom web application and accidentally type a number in a text field. The application returns an error message containing variable names, filenames, and the full path of the application. This is an example of which of the following?<p>A. Resource exhaustion</p><p>B. Improper error handling</p><p>C. Generic error message</p><p>D. Common misconfiguration</p>;B. When an application fails to properly trap an error and generates error messages containing potentially sensitive information, this is known as improper error handling.;threats-attacks-vulnerabilities
A web server in your organization has been defaced. The server is patched and properly configured as far as anyone can tell. Your logs show unusual traffic from external IP addresses just before the defacement occurred. It’s possible your server was attacked by which of the following?<p>A. Misconfiguration attack</p><p>B. Insider threat</p><p>C. Zero day exploit</p><p>D. Design weakness attack</p>;C. If a completely patched, properly configured server is successfully attacked, the most likely culprit is a zero day exploit. With zero day exploits, the vulnerability being exploited is unknown to the general public or the developer, so even a “fully patched” system is potentially vulnerable to zero day exploits.;threats-attacks-vulnerabilities
You’re working with a group testing a new application. You’ve noticed that when three or more of you click Submit on a specific form at the same time, the application crashes every time. This is most likely an example of which of the following?<p>A. A race condition</p><p>B. A nondeterministic error</p><p>C. Undocumented feature</p><p>D. DLL injection</p>;A. This is most likely an example of a race condition. A race condition is an error condition that occurs when the output of a function is dependent on the sequence or timing of the inputs. In this case, the application crashes when multiple inputs are submitted at the same time because the application is not receiving the inputs or handling the inputs in the expected order.;threats-attacks-vulnerabilities
Which of the following is a vulnerability related to a lack of vendor support?<p>A. The product has been declared “end-of-life” by the vendor.</p><p>B. The vendor is no longer in business.</p><p>C. The vendor does not support nonstandard configurations for its products.</p><p>D. All of the above.</p>;D. All of these are potential vulnerabilities associated with a lack of vendor support. When a vendor declares a product to be end-of-life, the vendor typically ends support for that product, which typically means it will provide no updates, patches, or maintenance even if critical vulnerabilities are later discovered. A vendor that no longer exists clearly can’t provide support or patches. Vendors that support only specific configurations may not provide maintenance, features, or patches that allow their product to work securely in your specific environment.;threats-attacks-vulnerabilities
An externally facing web server in your organization keeps crashing. Looking at the server after a reboot, you notice CPU usage is pegged and memory usage is rapidly climbing.

Distributed error handling</p><p>C. Resource exhaustion</p><p>D. Race condition</p>;C. Resource exhaustion is the state where a system does not have all of the resources it needs to continue to function. In this case the server does not have the memory or CPU capacity to handle the massive volume of HTTP/HTTPS requests that are coming into the server.;threats-attacks-vulnerabilities
A colleague on your team takes three times longer than you do to complete common tasks in a particular application. When you go to help him, you notice immediately that he doesn’t use any of the shortcuts designed into the application. When you ask him why he is not using shortcuts, he tells you he didn’t know the shortcuts exist. This is an example of which of the following?<p>A. An untrained user</p><p>B. Improper application configuration</p><p>C. Memory leak</p><p>D. Lack of vendor support</p>;A. Your colleague is an untrained user. Untrained users are users who do not know how to operate a system efficiently or securely because they haven’t received training associated with the system’s capabilities.;threats-attacks-vulnerabilities
Your organization is considering using a new ticket identifier with your current help desk system. The new identifier would be a 16-digit integer created by combining the date, time, and operator ID. Unfortunately, when you’ve tried using the new identifier in the “ticket number” field on your current system, the application crashes every time. The old method of using a 5-digit integer works just fine. This is most likely an example of which of the following?<p>A. Common misconfiguration</p><p>B. Zero day vulnerability</p><p>C. Memory leak</p><p>D. Integer overflow</p>;D. An integer overflow is a programming error condition that occurs when a program attempts to store a numeric value, an integer, in a variable that is too small to hold it. In this case the 16-digit integer is too large for the field that’s working just fine with the 5-digit integer.;threats-attacks-vulnerabilities
While examining a laptop infected with malware, you notice the malware loads on startup and also loads a file called netutilities.dll each time Microsoft Word is opened. This is an example of which of the following?<p>A. Zero day exploit</p><p>B. DLL injection</p><p>C. System infection</p><p>D. Memory overflow</p>;B. This is an example of DLL injection. DLL injection is the process of adding to a program at run time a DLL that has a specific vulnerability of function that can be capitalized upon by an attacker.;threats-attacks-vulnerabilities
You’re providing incident response services for a small company after a breach. The first thing you notice is the entire network is completely flat once you get behind the firewall. Services, user workstations, and printers are all on the same subnet with no VLANs or network segmentation. This is an example of what type of weakness?<p>A. Architecture/design weakness</p><p>B. Network traversal weakness</p><p>C. TCP overflow weakness</p><p>D. Memory leak weakness</p>;A. A flat network designed with no network segmentation increases the likelihood an attacker can easily traverse the network and gain access to sensitive information. The problem lies with the how the network was designed/built. This is known as an architecture/design weakness.;threats-attacks-vulnerabilities
A web application you are reviewing has an input field for username and indicates the username should be between 6 and 12 characters. You’ve discovered that if you input a username 150 characters or more in length, the application crashes. What is this is an example of?<p>A. Memory leak</p><p>B. Buffer overflow</p><p>C. Directory traversal</p><p>D. Integer overflow</p>;B. This is a fairly classic example of a buffer overflow. The input routine does not validate the provided input to ensure a maximum of 12 characters are received and processed. In this case, the application tries to store all 150 or more characters of the username, resulting in areas of memory being overwritten and causing the application to crash.;threats-attacks-vulnerabilities
You’ve been asked to help address some findings from a recent PCI (Payment Card Industry) audit, one of which is support for SSL 2.0 on a web server. Your CFO wants to know why SSL 2.0 support is a problem. You tell her SSL 2.0 support is an example of which of the following vulnerabilities?<p>A. Separation of duties</p><p>B. Default configuration</p><p>C. Resource exhaustion</p><p>D. Weak cipher suites</p>;D. SSL 2.0 is an example of a weak cipher suite. While technically the protocol used for SSL 2.0 is not a “vulnerability,” the cipher suites used in SSL 2.0 are cryptographically insecure—meaning an attacker can “break them” and access the content you are trying to protect.;threats-attacks-vulnerabilities
Your organization is having issues with a custom web application. The application seems to run fine for a while but starts to lock up or crash after 7 to 10 days of continuous use. Examining the server, you notice that memory usage seems to climb every day until the server runs out of memory. The application is most likely suffering from which of the following?<p>A. Memory leak</p><p>B. Overflow leak</p><p>C. Zero day exploit</p><p>D. Pointer dereference</p>;A. Memory leaks are programming errors caused when a computer program does not properly handle memory resources. Over time, while a program runs, if it does not clean memory resources as they are no longer needed, it can grow in size, with chunks of dead memory being scattered across the program’s footprint in memory. If a program executes for a long time, these can grow and consume resources, causing a system to crash.;threats-attacks-vulnerabilities
While examining internal network traffic, you notice a large amount of suspicious traffic coming from an IP address in the development environment. The IP address isn’t listed on any network diagram and shouldn’t be active on your network as far as you can tell. When you ask the developers about it, one of them tells you he set up that server over 12 months ago for a temporary project and forgot all about it. This is an example of which of the following?<p>A. Single server contingency</p><p>B. DLL injection</p><p>C. Undocumented asset</p><p>D. Insider threat</p>;C. This is a good example of an undocumented asset. The server was added to the environment, but the appropriate network documentation was never updated.;threats-attacks-vulnerabilities
While auditing an organization, you discover that new users are added to the domain by sending an e-mail request to the IT department, but the e-mails don’t always come from Human Resources, and IT doesn’t always check with HR to ensure the new user request corresponds to an authorized user. This is an example of which of the following?<p>A. Process overflow</p><p>B. Vulnerable business process</p><p>C. Insider threat</p><p>D. Trojan e-mail attack</p>;B. This is an example of a vulnerable business process. If IT is creating new user accounts based on e-mails it receives without validating that the requests are valid, then an attacker could take advantage of this process.;threats-attacks-vulnerabilities

You are browsing a website when your browser provides you with a warning message that “There is a problem with this website’s security certificate.” When you examine the certificate, it indicates that the root CA is not trusted . What most likely happened to cause this error?<p>A. The certificate was revoked.</p><p>B. The certificate does not have enough bit length for the TLS protocol.</p><p>C. The server’s CSR was not signed by a trusted CA.</p><p>D. The certificate has expired.</p>;C. In this case, the server’s CSR was not signed by a CA that is trusted by the endpoint computer, so no third-party trust can be established. This could be an indication of an attack, so the certificate should be manually verified before providing data to the web server.;cryptography-and-PKI
Taking a root CA offline is important for security purposes, but with the root CA offline, how does the PKI operate?<p>A. It has to be started periodically to provide CSR signing and CRL updates.</p><p>B. All services are delegated to an intermediate CA.</p><p>C. The endpoints cache the trust model until the root CA comes back online.</p><p>D. Pinning.</p>;B. You can take a root CA offline if all its normal services, such as signing CSRs and generating CRLs, are delegated to an intermediate CA. Because root CA certificates tend to have very long timelines, 20 years, and those of intermediate CAs are much shorter, 3 to 5 years, this solution works much better to avoid the problem of a compromised CA certificate.;cryptography-and-PKI
Why is pinning more important on mobile devices?<p>A. It uses elliptic curve cryptography.</p><p>B. It uses less power for pinned certificate requests.</p><p>C. It reduces network bandwidth usage by combining multiple CA requests into one.</p><p>D. It allows caching of a known good certificate when roaming to low-trust networks.</p>;D.

Answer B is incorrect because the Policy Decision Point (PDP) is responsible for making the final decision on whether to grant access to the client. Answer D is incorrect because the accounting and reporting system tracks the client network usage and reports the “who, what, where, when, and why.”;identity-and-access-control
If an organization wants to implement an enterprise access solution that does not require a user to remember passwords across multiple distinct business units, which of the following is the best choice?<p>A. Federation</p><p>B. Single sign-on</p><p>C. Transitive trusts</p><p>D. Retinal scanning</p>;A. Federation eliminates the requirement to use a password. The federation server stores the username in each application and presents that application with a token that is then used for authentication. Answer B is incorrect because SSO still requires the user to remember passwords. Answer C is incorrect because transitive trusts work only across trusted domains. Answer D is incorrect because retinal biometric identification involves the scanning and identification of blood vessels and tissues in the back of the eye, requiring specialized equipment.;identity-and-access-control
Which of the following processes occurs when the user provides appropriate credentials such as the correct password and a username?<p>A. Identification</p><p>B. Authentication</p><p>C. Authorization</p><p>D. Accounting</p>;B. Authentication is the process of validating an identity. This occurs when the user provides appropriate credentials such as the correct password and a username. Answer A is incorrect because identification occurs when a user or device presents information such as a username, a process ID, a smart card, or another unique identifier, claiming an identity. Answer C is incorrect because after identification and authentication, authorization of the request is determined before access rights during the session can be established. Authorization is based on security policy. Answer D is incorrect because accounting keeps track of the resources a user accesses by keeping a record of events of authentication and authorization actions.;identity-and-access-control
Which of the following best describes the Policy Decision Point (PDP) component of AAA functions?<p>A. Data holder</p><p>B. Final decision maker</p><p>C. Authenticator</p><p>D. Auditor</p>;B. The Policy Decision Point (PDP) is responsible for making the final decision on whether to grant access to the client. The PEP enforces the conditions of the client’s access. Answer A is incorrect because the Policy Information Point (PIP) holds data relevant to the decision of whether to grant access to the client. Answer C is incorrect because the Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) is the authenticator. Answer D is incorrect because the accounting and reporting system tracks the client network usage and reports the “who, what, where, when, and why.”;identity-and-access-control

An organization that relies heavily on cloud and SaaS service providers, such as Salesforce.com, WebEx, or Google, would have security concerns about which of the following?<p>A. TACACS+</p><p>B. SAML</p><p>C. LDAP</p><p>D. OpenID Connect</p>;B. SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) is an Extensible Markup Language (XML) framework for creating and exchanging security information between online partners. The weakness in the SAML identity chain is the integrity of users. To mitigate risk, SAML systems need to use timed sessions, HTTPS, and SSL/TLS. Answer A is incorrect because the TACACS+ protocol provides authentication and authorization in addition to accounting of access requests against a centralized service for authorization of access requests. Answer C is incorrect because LDAP is used for directory services. Answer D is incorrect because OpenID Connect uses a JSON Web Token (JWT) for authentication.;identity-and-access-control
An educational institution requires a secure solution that is capable of interfacing with state systems and other state-run universities. Which of the following is the best solution?<p>A. OAuth</p><p>B. SAML</p><p>C. Shibboleth</p><p>D. OpenID Connect</p>;C. Shibboleth is a flexible solution because it is based on standards. Some federated systems are designed to work only when the identity provider and the service provider are in the same organization. Shibboleth, however, works across organizations. Answer A is incorrect because OAuth provides only authorization services, it does not support secure methods such as client verification, encryption, or channel binding. Answer B is incorrect because the main purpose of SAML is single sign-on for enterprise users, it has a weakness in handling the integrity of users. Answer D is incorrect because OpenID Connect is an identity layer based on OAuth 2.0 specifications used for consumer single sign-on.;identity-and-access-control
An organization is implementing a server-side application using OAuth 2.0. Which of the following grant types should be used?<p>A. Authorization code</p><p>B. Implicit</p><p>C. Password credentials</p><p>D. Client credentials</p>;A. The authorization code grant type is used for server-side applications. Answer B is incorrect because the implicit grant type is used for client-side web applications. This grant type does not have a server-side component. Answer C is incorrect because the password credentials grant type is used for first-class web applications or mobile applications. Answer D is incorrect because the client credentials grant type is used for application code to allow an application to access its own resources.;identity-and-access-control
Which of the following is used with OAuth 2.0 as an extension to the authorization process?<p>A. Shibboleth</p><p>B. NTLM</p><p>C. LDAP</p><p>D. OpenID Connect</p>;D. OpenID Connect takes attacks into consideration and resolves many of the security issues with OAuth 2.0. Answer A is incorrect because Shibboleth is a SAML-based, open-source federated identity solution that provides single sign-on capabilities and federated services popular in research and educational institutions. Answer B is incorrect because NTLM is an older Microsoft authentication protocol that requires Active Directory and relies on Microsoft Windows user credentials in the authentication process. Answer C is incorrect because LDAP is used for directory services.;identity-and-access-control
An organization is implementing an application that needs service access to its own resources using OA 2.0. Which of the following grant types should be used?<p>A. Authorization code</p><p>B. Implicit</p><p>C. Password credentials</p><p>D. Client credentials</p>;D. The client credentials grant type is used for application code to allow an application to access its own resources. Answer A is incorrect because the authorization code grant type is used for server-side applications. Answer B is incorrect because the implicit grant type is used for client-side web applications. This grant type does not have a server-side component. Answer C is incorrect because the password credentials grant type is used for first-class web applications or mobile applications.;identity-and-access-control
Which of the following is a nonproprietary protocol that provides authentication and authorization in addition to accounting of access requests against a centralized service for the authorization of access requests?<p>A. TACACS+</p><p>B. SAML</p><p>C. LDAP</p><p>D. OAuth</p>;A. TACACS+, released as an open standard, is a protocol that provides authentication and authorization, as well as accounting of access requests against a centralized service for authorization of access requests. TACACS+ is similar to RADIUS but uses TCP instead of UDP transport. Answer B is incorrect because SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) is an Extensible Markup Language (XML) framework for creating and exchanging security information between online partners. Answer C is incorrect because LDAP is a directory services protocol. Answer D is incorrect because OAuth is an authorization framework.;identity-and-access-control
Which type of “something you have” factor do U.S. federal governmental employees and contractors use under HSPD 12?<p>A. Smart card</p><p>B. CAC</p><p>C. PIV</p><p>D. SecurID</p>;C. The personal identity verification (PIV) card is used by U.S. federal employees and contractors under HSPD 12. Answer A is incorrect because A, B, and C are all smart card variations, but only C is specifically used for federal employees and contractors under HSPD 12. Answer B is incorrect because the common access card (CAC) is used by U.S. military, military reserve, and military contractors. Answer D is incorrect because the RSA SecurID is an example of a time-shifting key token.;identity-and-access-control
Which of the following token-based solutions is considered the most secure?<p>A. OTP</p><p>B. TOTP</p><p>C. HOTP</p><p>D. OATH</p>;B. TOTP passwords keep changing and are valid for only a short period of time. Because of this difference, TOTP is considered to be more secure. Answer A is incorrect because one-time passwords (OTPs) are passwords that can be only used one time. The term is too generic because the two main standards for generating OTPs are TOTP and HOTP. Answer C is incorrect because HOTP passwords can be valid for an unknown amount of time, making it less secure than TOTP. Answer D is incorrect because OAUTH is the Initiative for Open Authentication that governs TOTP and HOTP.;identity-and-access-control
Which of the following is the best way to secure NoSQL databases such as MongoDB?<p>A. Implement separate authentication methods</p><p>B. Use the default port</p><p>C. Bind the interface to multiple IPs</p><p>D. Encrypt the data after it is written to the database</p>;A. The best way to secure NoSQL databases such as MongoDB is to implement separate authentication methods. Best practices for protecting NoSQL databases include changing the default ports, binding the interface to only one IP, and encrypting data in the application before writing it to the database. Databases such as MongoDB have added support for Kerberos authentication, more granular access controls, and SSL encryption, which allows for the implementation of separate authentication methods. Based on the explanation for answer A, answers B, C, and D are incorrect.;identity-and-access-control

The false rejection rate (FRR) is the percentage of identification instances in which false rejection occurs. Answer A is incorrect because the crossover error rate (CER) is the percentage at which the FAR and FRR are equal. Answer C is incorrect because the false acceptance rate (FAR) is a measure of the likelihood that the access system will wrongly accept an access attempt. Answer D is incorrect because the failure to acquire rate (FTA) is the rate of recognition attempts in which a biometric system fails to identify a biometric image.;identity-and-access-control
Which directory services protocol should be implemented to protect against man-in-the-middle data interception attacks?<p>A. Kerberos</p><p>B. NTLM</p><p>C. LDAP</p><p>D. Shibboleth</p>;A. The Kerberos protocol supports mutual authentication between two systems, protecting against man-in-the-middle forms of data interception or manipulation by ensuring that both network endpoints are authenticated to one another. Answer B is incorrect because NTLM is an older Microsoft authentication protocol that requires Active Directory and relies on Microsoft Windows user credentials in the authentication process. Answer C is incorrect because LDAP is used for directory services and is not secure. Answer D is incorrect because Shibboleth is an open source federated identity solution that provides single sign-on (SSO) capabilities and federated services popular in research and educational institutions.;identity-and-access-control
Which of the following is a type of “something you have” that uses a time-shifting key token?<p>A. Smart card</p><p>B. CAC</p><p>C. PIV</p><p>D. SecurID</p>;D. The RSA SecurID is an example of a time-shifting key token. Answer A is incorrect because it is a generic term and many smart card variations exist. Answer B is incorrect because the common access card (CAC) is used by the U.S. military, the military reserve, and military contractors. Answer C is incorrect because the personal identity verification (PIV) card is used by U.S. federal employees and contractors under HSPD 12.;identity-and-access-control
Which type of password policy protects against reuse of the same password?<p>A. Account lockout</p><p>B. Password complexity</p><p>C. Expiration</p><p>D. Password history</p>;D. The password history policy prevents reuse of the same passwords. Account lockout deactivates an account after a certain number of failed access attempts, making answer A incorrect. Answer B is incorrect because password complexity is a policy that determines how many types of characters must be used to create a strong password (lower- and uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols are the four general types of characters possible on a standard keyboard). Account expiration policies ensure that unused or no-longer-used accounts are properly disabled, making answer C incorrect.;identity-and-access-control
A user calls the help desk saying that she changed her password yesterday. She did not get any email on her mobile phone last night and she cannot log on this morning. Which password policy is most likely at fault for her difficulties?<p>A. Account lockout</p><p>B. Password complexity</p><p>C. Expiration</p><p>D. Password history</p>;A. If the user failed to also change her password on her phone, its repeated attempts to access email during the night would have triggered the account lockout protections and temporarily disabled her account. Password complexity and history would not lock out her account after successfully changing it, making answers B and D incorrect. Answer C is incorrect because, although account expiration is possible, it is unlikely that this happened unless it was near the end of her employment.;identity-and-access-control
Which of the following reduces the effectiveness of a good password policy?<p>A. Account lockout</p><p>B. Password recovery</p><p>C. Account disablement</p><p>D. Password reuse</p>;D. The longer the same password is used for a particular account, the greater the chance that an attacker will be able to determine the password through brute force attacks. Allowing users to reuse an old password greatly reduces the effectiveness of a good password policy. Answer A is incorrect because making the password length at least eight characters and requiring the use of the account lockout policy settings helps you prevent attackers from guessing users’ passwords. This decreases the likelihood of successful attacks on your network. Answer B is incorrect because it is used when a user forgets a password. Generally, two options exist for this: password recovery or a password reset. Answer C is incorrect because disabling user accounts is used when there might be a need to keep the settings, files, and folders intact so that the company can later access information tied to the user account by reenabling the account.;identity-and-access-control
Which of the following is considered best practice when formulating minimum standards for developing password policies?<p>A. Password length set to six characters</p><p>B. Required password change at 90 days</p><p>C. Maximum password age set to 0</p><p>D. Account lockout threshold set to 0</p>;B. Require users to change passwords every 90 to 180 days, depending on how secure the environment needs to be. Remember that the more often users are required to change passwords, the greater the chance that they will write them down, potentially exposing them to unauthorized use. Answer A is incorrect because making the password length at least eight characters and requiring the use of combinations of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters is good practice. Answer C is incorrect because good policy is to set the maximum password age to a value between 30 and 90 days. Answer D is incorrect because if the lockout threshold is set to zero, accounts will not be locked out due to invalid logon attempts.;identity-and-access-control
Which of the following is one of the first steps that must be taken to provide a secure account access environment?<p>A. Set user-assigned privileges</p><p>B. Implement user access reviews</p><p>C. Eliminate the use of shared accounts</p><p>D. Initiate continuous account monitoring</p>;C. One of the first steps that must be taken to provide a secure account access environment is to eliminate the use of shared accounts. Their use cannot be attributed to a particular user’s credentials, which precludes the determination of specific access rights and audit of access use. Answers A, B, and D are incorrect because they should be considered after original configuration and after the shared accounts have been eliminated. Answer A is incorrect because, in a user-based model, permissions are uniquely assigned to each user account, this happens after any shared accounts are eliminated. This access type is also found in government and military situations, as well as in private companies where patented processes and trademark products require protection. Answer B is incorrect because user access reviews allow the identification of misapplied changes or other access control adjustments through direct assignment or inherited nesting of role access rights. This is done after accounts are created. Answer D is incorrect because the purpose of continuous monitoring is to ensure that the processes for user account provisioning, life cycle management, and termination are followed and enforced. This process happens after the accounts have been secured.;identity-and-access-control
Which of the following is used to create a user identity profile and get the necessary information required to describe the identity?<p>A. Least privilege</p><p>B. Offboarding</p><p>C. Onboarding</p><p>D. Recertification</p>;C. Onboarding is the process for creating an identity profile and the necessary information required to describe the identity. Answer A is incorrect because least privilege is an access control practice in which a logon is provided only the bare minimum access to resources required to perform its tasks. Answer B is incorrect because offboarding is the process used when user identities that no longer require access to the environment are disabled or deactivated. Answer D is incorrect because access recertification is a more formal form of user access review.;identity-and-access-control
Which of the following policies addresses the need for other employees who can do the job of each employee so that corruption does not occur, and also helps minimize the impact when personnel leave their jobs?<p>A. Acceptable use</p><p>B. Least privilege</p><p>C. Mandatory vacations</p><p>D. Privacy policy</p>;C. Mandatory vacations addresses the need for other employees who can do the job of each employee. This helps mitigate corruption and minimizes the impact when personnel resign from their positions. Answer A is incorrect because an organization’s acceptable use policy provides details specifying what users may do with their network access. Answer B is incorrect. Least privilege addresses access rights for user accounts, mandating that only the minimum permissions necessary to perform work should be assigned to a user. Answer D is incorrect because privacy policy describes federal and state legislation requiring owners of commercial websites or online services to post how they collect and protect personal data.;risk-management
An organization is partnering with another organization that requires shared systems. Which of the following documents outlines how the shared systems will interface?<p>A. SLA</p><p>B. BPA</p><p>C. MOU</p><p>D. ISA</p>;D. An interconnection security agreement (ISA) is an agreement between organizations that have connected IT systems. Answer A is incorrect because a service level agreement (SLA) is a contract between a service provider and a customer that specifies the nature of the service to be provided and the level of service that the provider will offer to the customer. Answer B is incorrect because a business partner agreement (BPA) is a contract that establishes partner profit percentages, partner responsibilities, and exit strategies for partners. Answer C is incorrect because a memorandum of understanding (MOU) is a document that outlines the terms and details of an agreement between parties, including each party’s requirements and responsibilities.;risk-management
Which of the following are steps an organization can take to be sure compliance and performance standards are met in third-party or partner agreements? (Select two correct answers.)<p>A. Implement an acceptable use policy</p><p>B. Take appropriate action if the relationship presents elevated risk</p><p>C. Review third-party arrangements and performance annually</p><p>D. Sign a data ownership agreement</p>;B and C. Some additional steps an organization can take to ensure that compliance and performance standards are met include approving and reviewing third-party arrangements and performance annually, maintaining an updated list of all third-party relationships and reviewing the list periodically, taking appropriate action with any relationship that presents elevated risk, and reviewing all contracts for compliance with expectations and obligations. Answer A is incorrect because an acceptable use policy is geared toward terms a user must agree to follow to be provided with access service. Answer D is incorrect because a data ownership agreement is an agreement that some cloud service providers offer that specifically identifies the data owner and outlines ownership of relevant data.;risk-management
Which of the following requires users to remove sensitive and confidential materials from workspaces and lock items that are not in use when they leave their workstations?<p>A. Data handling policy</p><p>B. Clean desk policy</p><p>C. Tailgating training</p><p>D. Phishing attack training</p>;B. A clean desk policy requires users to remove sensitive and confidential materials from workspaces and to also lock items that are not in use when they leave their workstations. Answer A is incorrect because a data handling policy should address legal or regulatory requirements for accessing, transporting, storing, or disposing of data and data storage devices. Answer C is incorrect because tailgating involves following an authorized individual to avoid having to provide personal authorization credentials. Answer D is incorrect because phishing attacks training teaches users to avoid the natural response of opening every email that seems to be coming from family members, a boss, or coworkers.;risk-management
Which of the following designates the amount of data loss that is sustainable and up to what point in time data recovery could happen before business is disrupted?<p>A. RTO</p><p>B. MTBF</p><p>C. RPO</p><p>D. MTTF</p>;C. The recovery point objective (RPO) is the amount of time that can elapse during a disruption before the quantity of data lost during that period exceeds business continuity planning’s maximum allowable threshold. Simply put, RPO specifies the allowable data loss. It determines up to what point in time data recovery can happen before business is disrupted. Answer A is incorrect because the recovery time objective (RTO) is the amount of time within which a process must be restored after a disaster to meet business continuity. It defines how much time it takes to recover after notification of process disruption. Answer B is incorrect because mean time between failures (MTBF) is the average amount of time that passes between hardware component failures, excluding time spent waiting for or undergoing repairs. Answer D is incorrect because mean time to failure (MTTF) is the length of time a device or product is expected to last in operation.;risk-management
Eliminating email to avoid the risk of email-borne viruses is an effective solution but is not likely to be a realistic approach for which of the following?<p>A. Risk avoidance</p><p>B. Risk transference</p><p>C. Risk acceptance</p><p>D. Risk mitigation</p>;A. Risk avoidance involves eliminating the vulnerability that gives rise to a particular risk so that it is avoided altogether. This is the most effective solution, but is often not possible due to organizational requirements. Answer B is incorrect because risk transference involves either moving the risk to hosted providers who assume the responsibility for recovery and restoration or acquiring insurance to cover the costs from a risk. Answer C is incorrect because risk acceptance involves recognizing a risk, identifying it, and then accepting that it is sufficiently unlikely or of such limited impact that corrective controls are not warranted. Answer D is incorrect because risk mitigation involves reducing the likelihood or impact of a risk’s exposure by putting systems and policies into place to mitigate a risk and guard against the exploitation of vulnerabilities.;risk-management
Which of the following parties typically are notified first when a confirmed incident has occurred? (Select two correct answers.)<p>A. Press</p><p>B. CISO</p><p>C. End users</p><p>D. Legal</p>;B and D. The exact reporting requirements vary among organizations, but parties that are typically notified include the Chief Information Officer (CIO), Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), other internal incident response team members, human resources officers, public affairs personnel, the legal department, and law enforcement officers, when necessary. Answer A is incorrect because the press is not normally notified when an incident occurs. Answer C is incorrect because the users are not normally notified initially when an incident occurs.;risk-management

Log files</p>;C. Because big data is unstructured and located in diverse environments, the examiner might have difficulty proving that the evidence is original: The data has neither a validating hash nor a forensic image of the device. Answer A is incorrect because disk-to-image files are hashed to prove originality. Answer B is incorrect because disk-to-disk images are hashed to prove originality. Answer D is incorrect because when logs are needed as court evidence, organizations can collect copies of the original log files, the centralized log files, and interpreted log data.;risk-management
Which of the following information should be collected when collecting volatile data? (Select all correct answers.)<p>A. System date and time</p><p>B. Current network connections</p><p>C. Current open ports and applications listening on those ports</p><p>D. Full disk image</p>;A, B, and C. The following volatile information should be collected: system date and time, current network connections, current open ports and applications listening on those ports, and applications currently running. Answer D is incorrect because a full disk image is not volatile data.;risk-management
Which of the following provides a clear record of the path evidence takes from acquisition to disposal?<p>A. Video capture</p><p>B. Chain of custody</p><p>C. Hashes</p><p>D. Witness statements</p>;B. The chain of custody provides a clear record of the path evidence takes from acquisition to disposal. Answer A is incorrect because videotaping the actual entrance of a forensics team into the area helps refute claims that evidence was planted at the scene. Answer C is incorrect because hashes allow validation that the forensic analysis itself has not produced unexpected modifications of evidentiary data. Answer D is incorrect because witnesses provide statements about what they saw, including when, where, and how.;risk-management
Which recovery site has only power, telecommunications, and networking active all the time?<p>A. Hot site</p><p>B. Cold site</p><p>C. Warm site</p><p>D. Shielded site</p>;C. The warm site has basics such as power, networking, and telecommunications active all the time. Although alternate computers might be present, they are not loaded and operational as in a hot site, making answer A incorrect. Answer B is incorrect because a cold site generally includes only power and physical space when not in use. Answer D is incorrect because any of the recovery site types might or might not be shielded against electromagnetic interference.;risk-management
If an organization takes a full backup every Sunday morning and a daily differential backup each morning, what is the fewest number of backups that must be restored following a disaster on Friday?<p>A. 1</p><p>B. 2</p><p>C. 5</p><p>D. 6</p>;B. With a differential backup scheme, only the last full and last differential backups need to be restored. Therefore, daily full backups would require only the last full backup, making Answer A incorrect in this configuration. Answer C is incorrect because only the last full and last differential backups need to be restored. Answer D is incorrect because six is correct for an incremental backup instead of a differential backup, where the last full backup and all intervening incremental backups must be restored for recovery.;risk-management

Although the elliptic curve algorithm is typically a type of algorithm that is incorporated into other algorithms, it falls into the asymmetric family of algorithms because of its use of public and private keys, just like the RSA algorithm. Answers B and C are incorrect because 3DES and AES are symmetric encryption algorithms.;cryptography-and-PKI
You are tasked with configuring your web server with strong cipher suites. Which of the following should you choose as part of your cipher suite? (Choose three correct answers.)<p>A. RSA</p><p>B. RC4</p><p>C. AES</p><p>D. SHA</p>;A, C, and D. RSA, AES, and SHA comprise a suite for strong key exchange, authentication, bulk cipher, and message authentication. Answer B is incorrect because RC4 is considered a weak bulk cipher.;cryptography-and-PKI
Which one of the following EAP authentication protocols should you deploy to avoid having to deploy client or server certificates?<p>A. EAP-TLS</p><p>B. PEAP</p><p>C. EAP-TTLS</p><p>D. EAP-FAST</p>;D. EAP-FAST does not require either client or server certificates, instead, it uses a Protected Access Credential (PAC). Answer A is incorrect because EAP-TLS requires both client and server certificates. Answer B is incorrect because PEAP requires a server certificate. Answer C is incorrect because EAP-TTLS requires a server certificate.;cryptography-and-PKI
Which of the following statements is true when comparing CCMP and TKIP?<p>A. TKIP is more resource-intensive than CCMP, but it supports longer keys.</p><p>B. CCMP is more resource-intensive than TKIP, but it supports longer keys.</p><p>C. CCMP is less resource-intensive than TKIP, and it supports longer keys.</p><p>D. TKIP is less resource-intensive than CCMP, and it supports longer keys.</p>;B. CCMP replaced TKIP with the introduction of WPA2, providing for much longer keys and more advanced security. Although CCMP is more resource intensive, modern systems can handle the additional resources required. Answer A is entirely incorrect. Answer C is incorrect because although CCMP does support longer keys, it is not less resource-intensive than TKIP. Answer D is also incorrect because TKIP does not support longer keys, although it is less resource-intensive.;cryptography-and-PKI
To check the validity of a digital certificate, which one of the following is used?<p>A. Corporate security policy</p><p>B. Certificate policy</p><p>C. Certificate revocation list</p><p>D. Expired domain names</p>;C. A CRL provides a detailed list of certificates that are no longer valid. A corporate security policy does not provide current information on the validity of issued certificates, therefore, answer A is incorrect. A certificate policy does not provide information on the validity of issued certificates, either, therefore, answer B is incorrect. Finally, an expired domain name has no bearing on the validity of a digital certificate, therefore, answer D is incorrect.;cryptography-and-PKI
Which of the following is not a certificate trust model for arranging Certificate Authorities?<p>A. Bridge CA architecture</p><p>B. Sub-CA architecture</p><p>C. Single-CA architecture</p><p>D. Hierarchical CA architecture</p>;B. Sub-CA architecture does not represent a valid trust model. Answers A, C, and D all represent legitimate trust models. Another common model is cross-certification, however, implementing a bridge architecture usually makes more sense than using this type of model.;cryptography-and-PKI
Which of the following are included within a digital certificate? (Choose all the correct answers.)<p>A. User’s public key</p><p>B. User’s private key</p><p>C. Information about the user</p><p>D. Digital signature of the issuing CA</p>;A, C, and D. Information about the user, the user’s public key, and the digital signature of the issuing CA are all included within a digital certificate. A user’s private key should never be contained within the digital certificate and should remain under tight control, therefore, answer B is incorrect.;cryptography-and-PKI
Which of the following is not true about the expiration dates of certificates?<p>A. Certificates may be issued for a week.</p><p>B. Certificates are issued only at 1-year intervals.</p><p>C. Certificates may be issued for 20 years.</p><p>D. Certificates must always have an expiration date.</p>;B. Digital certificates contain a field indicating the date until which the certificate is valid. This date is mandatory, and the validity period can vary from a short period of time up to a number of years, therefore, answers A, C, and D are true statements.;cryptography-and-PKI
What type of certificate supplies mechanisms to help prevent phishing attacks and provides the highest level of trust?<p>A. DV</p><p>B. OV</p><p>C. EV</p><p>D. SAN</p>;C. EV, or extended validation, provides the highest level of trust and security features. Included are also mechanisms to prevent phishing attacks. DV certificates validate only the domain. OV certificates provider stronger validation over DV certificates, but the validation is not as comprehensive as for EV certificates. Thus, answers A and B are incorrect. Answer D is incorrect because a SAN certificate provides for multiple domain names or IP addresses with a single certificate, and is not considered a validated certificate type.;cryptography-and-PKI
Which one of the following is not true regarding DER-encoded certificates?<p>A. They are binary-encoded.</p><p>B. They include the BEGIN CERTIFICATE header.</p><p>C. The .cer and .crt extensions can be used instead of .der.</p><p>D. They are common to Java platforms.</p>;B. Because they are binary encoded and not Base64 ASCII, DER certificates cannot be edited with a text editor and do not contain such text, as PEM certificates do, for example. Answers A, C, and D are incorrect because these are all true of DER-encoded certificates.;cryptography-and-PKI
Which one of the following mechanisms places the responsibility for handling certificate status requests on the web server instead of the CA?<p>A. OCSP pinning</p><p>B. OCSP stapling</p><p>C. CRL pinning</p><p>D. CRL stapling</p>;B. OCSP stapling allows the web server to instead “staple” a time-stamped OCSP response as part of the TLS handshake with the client. The web server is now responsible for handling OCSP requests instead of the CA. Answers A, C, and D are incorrect. A CRL provides a mechanism for distributing certificate revocation information, and certificate pinning helps mitigate man-in-the-middle attacks.;cryptography-and-PKI
